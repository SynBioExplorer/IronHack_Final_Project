Project Description
The project is analysing water conflict events in transboundary water basins over the last 60 years. I tried to find a good predictor for the outcome of a water conflict through different machine learning models. 
   
Dataset

The data is sourced from the Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database:
“Product of the Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database, College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, Oregon State University.  Additional information about the TFDD can be found at: http://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu.”


Cleaning

Different Data cleaning and wrangling techniques have been used and are detailed specifally in the jupyter notebook.


Analytical Conclusions: 

-most disputes are settled cooperatively
-extreme results of disputes such as a war or unification into one nation are extremely rare
-institional stability and international treaties are important predictors of outcome
-there is no single good predictor for conflict outcome
-conflict likely going to increase in the future

Organization

The repository is organised into 2 different files. 
-google collab notebook: python code and ML analysis
-tableau: visualisastion and presentation
